# Red Teaming and Harm Reduction in Large Language Models: A Survey

This repository accompanies our survey paper, **"A Survey on Red Teaming and Harm Reduction in Large Language Models"**, which systematically reviews methodologies, ethical considerations, and practical experiments related to enhancing the safety, security, and ethical integrity of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Paper Overview

The paper covers:
- Fundamental concepts of Red Teaming applied to LLMs
- Technical and ethical challenges in adversarial testing
- Case studies and experimental validation of red teaming techniques
- Practical strategies and best practices for ensuring ethical and robust AI deployment

## Repository Contents

- `experiments/`: Contains code examples and prompts used in our experiments.
- `data/`: Example data or results from experiments.

## Reproducibility Note

Due to continuous updates and improvements in Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI's models), exact reproducibility of results presented in the paper cannot be guaranteed.
